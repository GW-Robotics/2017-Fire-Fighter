# 2017-Fire-Fighter
This repository is for the source code for GW Robotic's 2017 robot, which was entered in the Trinity College Firefighting Robot Contest and will be entered in the GW SEAS Innovation Challenge. It has an Arduino and Python implementation of the code due to various time constraints.
# Documentation
[In-Progress] The robot's documentation can be found on its [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/GW-Robotics/2017-Fire-Fighter/wiki).
# Installation
[To-Do] Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/GW-Robotics/gwrobolib/wiki/Installation).
# Arduino-Project Organisation
The Arduino implementation was written as a last-minute project to have a working robot for the Trinity College Firefighting Robot Contest and therefore does not have a clear structure. All logic is within the .ino file.
# Python-Project Organisation
- 2017-Fire-Fighter: Source files for the project
- bin: Compiled files and binaries
- docs: Project documentation files for ease of management
- tests: Automated test files for the project
- setup.py: Set-up script to download all modules for the project
- resources: Files that are used by the code, such as vision images
- arduino: Test files for implementing sensors in Arduino (for those not familiar with Python implementaton). All files will be converted to Python.
